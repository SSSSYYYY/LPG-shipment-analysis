This is a co-project with a industry partner.

Objective:assesses the feasibility of using the empty liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) vesselrecord to predict the how much LPG will be shipped in the future. 

Python packages used:
                     explortory:pandas, numpy, datetime
                     model: sklearn, matplotlib.pyplot, scipy
                     
Analytical roadmap:
(1) Data processing and cleaning
(2) Data understanding and explortory analysis
(3) New feature creating
(4) Model training (Linear/ Ridge/ SVR)
(5) Test data evaluation
(6) Iterate step (3)~(5)
(7) Model selection & predictoin

Outcome: the ridge regression performs the best with an average rMAE value of 5.20%, average training R2 score of 0.822. The model  can help predict the future amount of LPG being shipped three weeks after the detection of empty moving vessels
